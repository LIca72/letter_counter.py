# Letter Counter 🐍

This is a simple Python program that counts how many times each letter appears in a word entered by the user.

## How it works:
- The user enters a word.
- The program creates a dictionary to store each letter as a key and the number of times it appears as the value.
- It prints each letter with the number of times it appears in the word.

## Example:
Enter the word: hello

Letter count in the word:
h: 1
e: 1
l: 2
o: 1
